# Calendar Clone

This project is a calendar application built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**. It allows users to create, update, and manage events on a calendar. The application supports both full-day and timed events and includes features such as event overflow handling and theme toggling.

For this project, I focused on improving my skills in TypeScript and testing. Since this is my first side project using these technologies, I am quite happy with how it turned out. However, I recognize that there is still a lot to learn and explore.

## Features

-   **Event Management**: Create, update, and delete events.
-   **Full-Day and Timed Events**: Support for full-day events that can span multiple days or months, as well as events with specific start and end times.
-   **Event Overflow Handling**: Properly handles event overflow in the calendar view
-   **Theme Toggle**: Switch between light, dark, and system themes.
-   **Time Localization**: Supports localization for date and time formats.

### Features I Wanted to Add

There are a bunch of cool features I didn’t get to yet, but I plan to come back and add them. Here’s what’s on my to-do list:

-   **Mobile Responsiveness**: Make the app work better on smaller screens.
-   **Program View**: A simple list of events, like Google Calendar
-   **Drag-and-Drop Events**: Moving events in the calendar.
-   **Language Localization**: Add support for different languages using **react-i18next**.
-   **Settings**:
    -   Start day of the week (currently fixed to Monday).
    -   Time format.
    -   Locale/country preferences.
    -   Highlight past days or events.
    -   Other settings like you’d find in Google Calendar.

Even though these features aren’t done yet, I’m planning to come back to this project to finish them. Plus, I want to try out some new tech while I’m at it!

### Future Ideas & Tech Updates

Here are some things I want to add or improve in the future:

-   **Next.js**: Rebuild the app with Next.js for better performance and features.
-   **Google Calendar API**: Sync events with Google Calendar.
-   **Authentication**: Implement user account creation.
-   **Supabase**: Store events in a database using Supabase, instead of localStorage.
-   **Change Cypress to Playwright**: I want to study more on Cypress but also learn Playwright. I think they are both great for end-to-end testing, and I would like to see the differences.
-   **Different Calendar Views**: To be able to see day, week, and year calendar views with the hours.
